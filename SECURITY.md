# Security Policy — Hektor

Thank you for helping keep Hektor secure. Please report vulnerabilities privately so we can fix them before public disclosure.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Preferred: Open a private GitHub Security Advisory for this repository (recommended).
If you cannot use that, email: security@hektor.example.com (PGP: 0123ABCD... replace with real key).

When reporting, please include:
- A clear description and impact (e.g., RCE, auth bypass).
- Steps to reproduce a minimal test case or PoC.
- Affected versions and environment.
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations.
- Your preferred contact method and whether you want credit.

If the issue is actively exploitable or causing harm, include "URGENT" in the subject and escalate by phone: +1-XXX-XXX-XXXX.

## Supported Versions
We consider vulnerabilities in the following supported branches/releases:
- main (active development)
- Releases since 2024-01 (LTS)
If you report an issue in an unsupported, end-of-life release, we will evaluate but may not provide a fix for that release.

## Response & Remediation Timeline
- Acknowledgement: within 48 hours.
- Triage and initial plan: within 7 days.
- Fix or mitigation: timeline depends on severity; critical issues prioritized. If a fix will take longer, we will provide regular updates.
- Coordinated disclosure: we ask reporters to coordinate disclosure with us. Typical embargo: 30–90 days depending on severity and complexity.

## Credit & CVE
- We will offer attribution by default unless you request anonymity.
- For issues warranting a CVE, we will coordinate allocation and disclosure.

## Safe Harbor
Good-faith security research is welcomed. We will not pursue legal action against security researchers who follow this policy and act in good faith.

## Out of Scope
- Bug reports without security impact
- Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies (report to vendor and optionally to us)

## After Disclosure
We will publish a fixed release and release notes detailing the issue and mitigation, and credit researchers as agreed.
