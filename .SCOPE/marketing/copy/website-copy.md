### Above the Fold
**Section**: Why HEKTOR?

Not all vectors are created equal. Medical imaging, agricultural sensors, remote sensing - these applications need databases that understand perception and spectra, not just mathematical distance.

HEKTOR is the first vector database optimized for how humans perceive similarity.

### Features Section
**Performance**
Sub-3ms Queries
SIMD-optimized HNSW with AVX-512 vectorization. 30-60% faster than alternatives.

**Perceptual Accuracy**
98.1% Recall@10
Perceptual quantization using HDR encoding (PQ curves, HLG). Human-aligned similarity.

**Billion-Scale**
Handle Billions
Kinetic sharding with ML-based workload prediction. Adaptive partitioning for skewed workloads.

**Spectral Ready**
Color & Spectra

## About Page

### Company Story
HEKTOR emerged from a simple observation: traditional vector databases treat all vectors the same, optimizing for mathematical distance. But in visual AI, medical imaging, and spectral applications, what matters is perceptual similarity - how humans perceive likeness.

We built the first vector database that understands perception and spectra.

### Mission
Make perceptually-accurate, billion-scale vector search accessible to every AI builder.

### Values
- **Evidence-based**: Benchmarks, not claims
- **Open by default**: MIT licensed, community-driven
- **Technical depth**: No shortcuts, no hand-waving
- **User obsessed**: Build what developers actually need

### Team
Led by database systems researchers and computer vision experts with backgrounds from [companies/universities].

### Open Source
HEKTOR is MIT licensed and always will be. We believe in transparency, community, and no vendor lock-in.
