## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Publishing without review** (even for "quick posts")  
❌ **Broken links** (test every link before publishing)  
❌ **Typos in titles** (most visible, most damaging)  
❌ **Missing CTAs** (every piece needs next step)  
❌ **Wrong dates/versions** (check before publishing)  
❌ **Competitor bashing** (stay professional)  
❌ **Overpromising** (only claim what's true today)  
❌ **Ignoring comments** (engagement matters)

---

## Crisis Protocol

### If You Published Something Wrong

**Minor (typo, broken link)**:
1. Fix immediately
2. Note in changelog (if blog/docs)
3. Move on

**Major (wrong data, offensive, legal issue)**:
1. Unpublish/delete immediately
2. Alert manager and leadership
3. Draft correction/apology
4. Get approval before re-publishing
5. Document what happened
6. Update checklist to prevent recurrence

**Policy**: Better to delay 24 hours for review than fix a crisis.

---

## Metrics to Track

**Awareness**:
- Impressions, reach, views

**Engagement**:
- Likes, comments, shares, time on page

**Conversion**:
- Click-through rate, signups, demo requests

**Quality**:
- Bounce rate, pages per session, return visits

**Goal**: Every piece of content should have clear success metrics defined before publishing.

---

## Tools

**Writing**: Grammarly (grammar), Hemingway (readability)  
**Design**: Canva/Figma (visuals), SVGO (SVG optimization)  
**SEO**: Yoast/RankMath (WordPress), Ahrefs (research)  
**Analytics**: Google Analytics, LinkedIn Insights, Twitter Analytics  
**Project Management**: Notion/Asana (content calendar)

---

## Continuous Improvement

**Monthly**: Review this checklist, update based on learnings  
**Quarterly**: Major revision based on 90-day retrospective  
**Annually**: Complete overhaul if needed

---

## Quick Reference

**Before publishing, ask yourself**:
1. Is this accurate?
2. Is this helpful?
3. Is this on-brand?
4. Is this approved (if needed)?
5. Am I prepared to engage with responses?

If 5x YES → Publish  
If any NO → Fix first

---

**Remember**: Quality > Speed. It's OK to delay publication to get it right.
