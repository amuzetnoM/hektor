## About

This blog documents the journey of building Hektor, a high-performance vector database. It's written for engineers who want to understand not just what we built, but why and how.

Topics covered:
- Vector search algorithms (HNSW, IVF)
- Quantization techniques (PQ, SQ, perceptual)
- Hybrid search (BM25 + vectors)
- System architecture (C++23, SIMD, memory mapping)
- Production engineering (testing, CI/CD, packaging)

All opinions are my own. Code examples are from Hektor's codebase.
