# Draft Release Notes — v4.0.0 (DRAFT)

**Title:** Hektor v4.0.0 — Billion-scale Performance & Perceptual Quantization

**Release date:** 2026-01-21 (draft)

**One-line summary:** Hektor reaches production-grade billion-scale support with industry-first perceptual quantization, enhanced observability, and an exhaustive system snapshot documenting architecture and performance.

## Highlights
- Billion-scale verification: 1B+ vectors with 8.5ms p99 latency and 85K QPS in distributed configurations.
- Perceptual Quantization improvements: Display-aware PQ curves (SMPTE ST 2084) yielding better recall at significantly reduced memory footprint.
- Observability: OpenTelemetry integration, eBPF profiling, Prometheus metrics, and monitoring dashboards.
- Packaging & automation: Improved build scripts, Docker images, CI/CD updates, and release automation.
- Documentation: Full system snapshot in `docs/research/HEKTOR_ANALYSIS.md` capturing exhaustive benchmarks, architecture, and research.

## Notable counts (since v3.0.0)
- Commits: 112 (est. 13 feature-like, 17 fixes, 65 other improvements)  
- Merge commits: 17

## Migration & Upgrade Notes
- No breaking API changes are expected. Projects on v3.x should be compatible; re-indexing with PQ profiles is recommended for best results.

## Assets to attach
- `docs/research/HEKTOR_ANALYSIS.md` (system snapshot - exhaustive)
- Release changelog: `docs/changelog/v4.0.0.md`
