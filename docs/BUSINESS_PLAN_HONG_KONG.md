## CONCLUSION

Hong Kong presents a compelling opportunity for establishing both Hektor Vector Database and Artifact Virtual Enterprise. The combination of:

✅ Strategic APAC location with mainland China access  
✅ Low corporate tax and business-friendly environment  
✅ World-class infrastructure and connectivity  
✅ Strong talent pool and research institutions  
✅ Government support for technology development  
✅ Established financial and legal systems

Makes Hong Kong an excellent choice for these ventures. With an initial investment of HKD $50-65M (USD $6.4-8.3M) and disciplined execution, both businesses can achieve break-even by late 2027 and strong profitability thereafter.

The projected 3-year revenue of HKD $160M (USD $20.5M) and EBITDA of HKD $65M (USD $8.3M) demonstrates the viability and attractiveness of this opportunity.
