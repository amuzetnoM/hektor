# v4.0.0

Hektor v4.0.0 (Vector Studio) is a major milestone release that validates billion-scale performance and ships production-grade perceptual quantization, enhancing recall, memory efficiency, and distributed throughput. This release consolidates large-scale performance engineering, observability, and comprehensive documentation into a single system snapshot.

Release date: 2026-01-21

Highlights
- Billion-scale verified at 1B+ vectors: 8.5ms p99 (cluster), 85K QPS (distributed) with PQ-enabled configurations.
- Perceptual Quantization: Display-aware PQ (SMPTE ST 2084) optimized for image/video embeddings with improved recall and large memory savings at scale.
- Observability & Monitoring: OpenTelemetry distributed tracing, eBPF profiling, Prometheus metrics, and monitoring dashboards.
- Packaging & Automation: Improved build and release automation, docker images (multi-arch), and installation scripts.
- Documentation: Exhaustive system snapshot and research artifacts (see `docs/research/HEKTOR_ANALYSIS.md`).

Statistics (since v3.0.0)
- Commits: 112 (approx. 13 feature-like, 17 fixes, 65 other improvements)
- Merge commits: 17

Migration Notes
- No breaking API changes expected. Backward compatible with v3.x releases.
- Recommended: run compatibility tests and reindex with PQ profiles for production systems.
