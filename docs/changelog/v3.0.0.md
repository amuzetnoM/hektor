# v3.0.0

**Release Date:** January 8, 2026  
**Status:** Major Release

## Overview

Hektor v3.0.0 is a major release that adds a complete, production-ready command-line interface with native NLP capabilities and hybrid search (vector + lexical). The release focuses on operational tooling (118+ CLI commands), model and monitoring tooling, and improved ingestion and search workflows while remaining backward compatible with v2.x.

**See also:** System Snapshot and exhaustive v4.0.0 analysis: `docs/research/HEKTOR_ANALYSIS.md`.

## New Features

### Comprehensive CLI System
- **118+ Commands** spanning 18 categories for database management, ingestion, search, model management, monitoring, and reporting
- **Interactive REPL** with history, tab completion, and colorized output
- **CLI Documentation** and quick references in `src/cli/docs/`

### Native NLP Engine
- Bare-metal C++ NLP routines for embeddings, NER, and text analysis
- Fast on-CPU inference (500+ embeddings/sec reported on typical CPU)

### Hybrid Search
- Vector + BM25 hybrid search with **5 fusion methods** (RRF, Weighted Sum, CombSUM, CombMNZ, Borda)
- Improved recall and precision via fusion

### Model & Ingestion Management
- Multi-source ingestion (chunking and connectors) supporting 10+ sources
- Model download, quantization and benchmarking tooling
- Quantization performance improvements (up to 4x speedups with INT8)

### Monitoring & Reporting
- Prometheus metrics, dashboards, and real-time monitoring hooks
- Audit and usage reporting commands

## Technical Details
- **Documentation size:** ~195KB of CLI docs in `src/cli/docs/`
- **Command coverage:** 118+ commands across 18 categories
- **Implementation:** Mix of C++ (NLP engine), and tooling around the core database

## Testing
- Unit and integration tests added for major CLI commands, hybrid search, and NLP components
- Targets include CLI correctness, interoperability with existing APIs, and CI validation

## Quality Assurance
- Backward-compatible changes with no breaking API changes
- Secure defaults for credential handling (no plaintext credentials in command-line history)
- Careful input validation and error handling

## Docker Deployment
- Multi-stage Docker builds recommended for minimal images
- Images should use non-root users and include healthchecks for production

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Initialize database
hektor init ./mydb --preset gold-standard

# Add documents
hektor add ./mydb --text "Gold prices rising"
hektor add ./mydb --file document.txt

# Hybrid search with fusion
hektor hybrid:search ./mydb "analysis" --fusion rrf -k 20

# NLP operations
hektor nlp:embed --text "gold prices" --model all-MiniLM-L6-v2
```

## Migration Guide
- **No breaking changes.** Existing v2.x CLI and APIs continue to work alongside the new `hektor` CLI.
- Recommended: switch to `hektor` CLI for new workflows and automation scripts.

## Performance
- Search: Sub-millisecond latency for typical queries
- NLP: ~500+ embeddings/sec on CPU reported
- Ingestion: 5,000+ docs/sec with optimized parallel ingestion
- Quantization: up to 4x speedup with INT8 on supported models

## Documentation
See the CLI docs in `src/cli/docs/` for full command reference and implementation notes.

## Breaking Changes
None — fully backward compatible with v2.x

## Dependencies
Optional dependencies: ONNX/llama.cpp/quantization toolchains for model tooling and embedding runtimes
